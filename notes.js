 * User makes a deposit
 * User chooses the game to play, 
 * User / player adds a bet amount for that selected game session
 * Then clicks start game
 * The spin button allows the user to spin and a number of objects will randomly display on the screen
 * A win is recorded if some kind of same (matching objects) have matched a particular pattern on the screen
 * If a user wins - their points increase, (which are basically used to calculate their profits)
 * But if no pattern matched, user losses points in that particular spin. 
 * In this game users will race against number of spins (given 20 spins without a given match / or winning jackpot) the user losses
